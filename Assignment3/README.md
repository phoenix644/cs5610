## Iteration0

this Iteration is consisting of front end, using React DOM Router and Bootstrap and backend using nodejs, as you can see, 
and at the end, i installed axios and mongoose to create the connection to the DB, 
but at this step i am not fetching data from DB, as currently i am getting data from note.js file. 

### to run the frontend and backend please use following command:

npm run dev
